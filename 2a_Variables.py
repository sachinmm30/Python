# VARIABLES IN PYTHON
#     Variables in Python are used to store data values. They are created when you assign a value to them, and you donâ€™t need to declare their type (Python is dynamically typed).

# Syntax for Variable Assignment:x = 5  # Assigning an integer value to the variable x
#                               y = "Hello"  # Assigning a string value to the variable y

# Variable Naming Rules:
#     Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).
#     Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore.
#     Variable names are case-sensitive (Name and name are different).

# Examples
#     age = 25
#     name = "John"
#     is_student = True 

name="Bng"
NAME="MYS"
